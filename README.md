## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### Continued development

In future projects, I intend to continue using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style for writing commit messages. This project was the first time I applied this convention using prefixes like "feat" and "refactor".

### Useful resources

- [CSS @media Rule](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/atrule_media.php) - This helped me as a little refresher on media rules.
